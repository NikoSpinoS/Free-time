      <li><p style="font-size:40px;"><a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites" style="color:blue; font-family:impact;">Ratting</a></p>
      <p style="color:black; font-family:arial;">
        <b>Ratting is based on the budget of the ship that you're flying. If your<br>
        ship is rational for the rats that you are about to engage, then you won't<br>
        have any problem. Drone ships are very recommended for ratting, as they<br>
        can kite and be unable to get hit. <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gila" style="color:tomato;">Gila</a>
        is a very good cruiser for ratting with<br> its huge drone damage and hitpoints bonuses. It's not that recommended for<br>
        new players as it cost about 200 million ISK but it's worth buying.</b>

      <li><p style="font-size:40px;"><a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search=Exploring" style="color:blue; font-family:impact;">Exploration</a></p>
      <p style="color:black; font-family:arial;"><b>Exploration is as risky as an effective way to make ISK.<br>
        If you are a new player and interested on exploration, there are some tier-1<br>
        frigates that are used for exploration, like: <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Heron" style="color:tomato;">Heron</a>,
        <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Imicus" style="color:tomato;">Imicus</a>, <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Probe" style="color:tomato;">Probe</a>
        and <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Magnate" style="color:tomato;">Magnate</a>.<br>
        With a little attention to dscan and local, they are good for doing data and relic sites.<br> Unfortunately, only omegas can fit a cloaking device, that's the reason that makes it risky.</b>

      <li><p style="font-size:40px; font-family:arial;"><a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mining" style="color:blue; font-family:impact;">Mining</a></p>
      <p style="color:black; font-family:arial"><b>The safest way to make ISK, is mining.<br>
        If you recently joined New Eden, train some industry core skills, take your<br>
        <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Venture" style="color:tomato;">Venture</a> and start mining some asteroid belts. The ore that you<br>
         mined, you can sell it, or reprocess it and gain materials that are used for<br>
        crafting ships, modules and everything that you need. Ore's value depends on the<br>
         system's security, which means that low security systems contain more expensive ore.</b>
